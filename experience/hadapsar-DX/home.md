Hadapsar helps developers in scaling the DApp. The DApp contracts can be deployed on Hadapsar chain and can appreciate the provided horizontal scaling. Through the gateways, the developers can maintain the available economy for their respective tokens.

ERC20 tokens can be moved between chains by depositing on origin chain, which after facilitator action will be available as utility token on the metachain. If the token does not exist on the metachain then it will be deployed and the mapping will be created for all the registered tokens. These utility tokens can later be withdrawn from the metachain and will be made available to the desired beneficiary account on the origin chain.

Explorer helps in tracking the origin chain and the metachain. Transaction specific to the DApp can be tracked and monitored using the provided metachain explorer. The faucet can be used to get the gas on the metachain which is required for the deployment of the DApp contracts and also for performing the transactions.
